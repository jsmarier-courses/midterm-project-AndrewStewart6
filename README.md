In this assignment, I was given a dataset covering the service requests made to the city of ottawa. When parsing through this dataset, I conducted a VIMO analysis, cleaned the data by freezing, adding white space, and splitting columns, and conducted an exploratory analysis based on a pivot table and graph I created to discover that many requests being made to the city of ottawa were not being assigned wards, especially in the water and environment requests.
